**About**  
I am an independent researcher focused on relating climate change science to climate action policy. In  particular, I look at national (and EU) level, to assess progress relative to equitable achievement of the Paris Agreement temperature goal. This means I have to be a generalist, meaning that I look at how all the areas of societal activity \– energy (electricity, transport, heating), industry, agriculture, and land use \– "add up" in fact and in the context of effective society\-wide climate action. My previous career as a structural carpenter, working on new and historic oak-frame buildings, means I think mostly in terms of delivering the required outcomes and pathways within input **quantity** limits. This is a more useful guide to assessing our shared future than projections based on notional cost pathways.
